description: <p>In her earlier works, Helen Keller described the details of the early
  illness that left her deaf and blind, and in the prevailing opinion of the day,
  unable to be educated, as well as the methods that were eventually used to teach
  her how to communicate. In the remarkable memoir <i>The World I Live In</i>, Keller
  offers a much more personal take on her situation, inviting readers inside her own
  personal experience.
